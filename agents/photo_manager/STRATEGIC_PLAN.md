## 🎯 THE REVENUE PROBLEM
**Reality Check:** Photography niches are crowded. We win by being more *technical* and *specific*.
- **High Ticket Items:** Telescopes ($500-$5000) and Lenses ($800+) have massive commissions.
- **The Issue:** General photography blogs are shallow. We must be the "Physics Ph.D." of the niche.

## 🏆 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (Next 30 Days)

### PHASE 1: ASTRO DOMINATION (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Own the "Astrophotography" vertical.
- High barrier to entry = lower competition.
- High gear requirements = higher affiliate AOV.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Audit all "Best Telescope" posts for out-of-stock items (crucial for high-ticket).
- [ ] Create deep-dive guides on technical concepts (e.g., "Understanding Coma in Fast Newtonians").
- [ ] Internal Linking: Connect every "How to Photograph X" guide to specific gear reviews.

### PHASE 2: VISUAL AUTHORITY (Week 2-3)
**Goal:** Prove we are photographers, not just AI wrappers.
- [ ] Add EXIF data tables to all photo examples.
- [ ] Create "Lens Charts" (MTF curves, sharpness comparisons) for top reviews.
- [ ] Fix any broken images or missing Alt Text (SEO + Accessibility).

### PHASE 3: TECHNICAL SEO (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Speed and Structure.
- [ ] Implement `ImageObject` schema for all original photos.
- [ ] Optimize load times (lazy loading heavy galaxy images).
- [ ] Fix 404s and orphan posts.

## 💰 REVENUE FOCUS
**High-Ticket Affiliate Only (No Display Ads Yet)**
**Primary Goal:** Drive sales for DWARF Smart Telescopes & Amazon Gear.

**High-Intent Keywords to Target:**
1. "dwarf 3 smart telescope review" (Direct Affiliate Commission)
2. "best telescope for deep space" (High Commission)
3. "star tracker for dslr" (Medium Commission, High Volume)

## 🎯 THE DOMINATION MINDSET
**We don't just review gear; we explain the PHOTONS.**
- **Competitors** say "It's sharp."
- **We** say "It resolves 3.4 arc-seconds at the edge of the field."
- **Result:** Trust. Trust = Clicks. Clicks = Revenue.
