# TIGER TRIBE - STRATEGIC DOMINATION PLAN
**Owner:** Cat Manager Agent (The Apex Predator)
**Mission:** Hunt keywords, dominate territories, and protect the pride.
**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Source of Truth:** This document is the primary tactical roadmap.

## 🤖 TECHNICAL IDENTITY
**Your Site Prefix:** `WP_TIGERTRIBE_NET`

## 🎨 CONTENT CREATION PROTOCOL
**Featured Images:** You MUST use Gemini 2.5 Flash for all new posts.

- **Rule:** 16:9 Aspect Ratio (Automatic). No text overlay.

## 🎯 THE REVENUE PROBLEM
**Reality Check:** "Animal Facts" is low-RPM. We win by pivoting to "Conservation" and "Wildlife Encounters" (High Ticket).
- **Safari Travel:** Affiliates pay big commissions ($300+ per booking).
- **Ad Arbitrage:** Viral lists ("10 Deadliest Cats") drive massive pageviews & ad revenue.
- **The Issue:** We rank for generic "tiger facts" but miss the intent for "African Safari Cost".

## 🏆 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (Next 30 Days)

### PHASE 1: TERRITORY EXPANSION (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Expand keyword footprint.
- We don't just own "Tiger"; we must own "Jaguar", "Leopard", and "Clouded Leopard".
- Identify "Under-served species" (Ocelot, Caracal) with low competition.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Create "VS" Battles (Top 10 Predator Fights) - Highly viral, huge social shares.
- [ ] Launch "Endangered Species Profile" series (Authority + Conservation links).
- [ ] Optimize meta descriptions for "Click Through Rate" (CTR) - Make them dramatic.

### PHASE 2: CONSERVATION AUTHORITY (Week 2-3)
**Goal:** Build backlinks from .org/.edu sites.
- [ ] Write data-driven pieces on "Habitat Loss Statistics 2026".
- [ ] Link out to major foundations (WWF, Panthera) to signal trust.
- [ ] Create "How to Help" guides with clear donation paths (or merch affiliates).

### PHASE 3: TECHNICAL HUNT (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Speed and Schema.
- [ ] Implement `VideoObject` schema for all predator clips.
- [ ] Fix broken internal links (orphaned cubs must be rescued).
- [ ] Ensure mobile readability is perfect (70% of traffic is mobile/social).

## 💰 REVENUE FOCUS
**High-Intent Keywords to Target:**
1. "best african safari for big cats" (High Commission)
2. "wildlife photography tour india" (High Commission)
3. "tiger conservation donation" (Trust Signal)

## 🎯 THE DOMINATION MINDSET
**We are not house cats. We are the JUNGLE.**
- **Competitors** list dry facts.
- **We** tell the story of the hunt.
- **Result:** Engagement. Time on Page. Ad Revenue.
