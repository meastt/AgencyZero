## 🎯 TOP 3 OPPORTUNITIES (Ranked by Impact)

### 1. BEST OUTDOOR GRIDDLE (URGENT) 🔥
**Current Performance:**
- URL: `/best-outdoor-griddle/`
- Position: **52.2** (Page 6 - BURIED)
- Impressions: **108/month** (high commercial intent)
- Clicks: 8 (7.4% CTR)
- **Potential:** Position 52 → Top 10 could = 50+ clicks/month

**Competitive Intel:**
- Barbecue Lab: 8 models + VIDEO review
- NYT Wirecutter: 2 picks (Traeger Flatrock featured)
- Smoked BBQ Source: 9 griddles tested
- Consumer Reports: 3 picks with testing methodology
- Best Home Gear: 10 griddles

**Our Content Issues:**
1. ❌ Vague title: "Griddle Goals: How to Pick..." (doesn't signal product roundup)
2. ❌ Inconsistent dates (intro says 2025, title says 2026)
3. ❌ Only 8 models (competitors have 9-10)
4. ❌ No clear "Top Pick" or "Best Overall" callout
5. ❌ Missing 2026 models (Traeger Flatrock, Grilla Primate)
6. ❌ No video content
7. ❌ Generic intro (doesn't hook commercial-intent searchers)
8. ❌ Likely missing schema markup for products

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] Update title: "Best Outdoor Griddles 2026: Expert Reviews of 10 Top Models"
- [ ] Add 2 new models: Traeger Flatrock 3 Zone, Grilla Primate
- [ ] Create "Top Pick" / "Best Value" / "Premium Choice" sections
- [ ] Rewrite intro (hook: specific use cases, quick verdict table)
- [ ] Add comparison table with specs
- [ ] Implement product schema markup
- [ ] Add internal links from 3-5 related posts
- [ ] Update all dates to 2026 consistently
- [ ] Consider adding YouTube embed (if we have video) or create one

**Impact Estimate:** 
Position 52 → Position 8 = **+400% traffic increase** (~40 clicks/month)

### 2. BLACKSTONE PELLET COMBO REVIEW (HUGE VOLUME) 💰
**Current Performance:**
- URL: `/blackstone-xl-pellet-grill-and-griddle-combo-review/`
- Position: **62.4** (Page 7)
- Impressions: **320/month** (MASSIVE VOLUME!)
- Clicks: 2 (0.6% CTR - DISASTER)
- **Potential:** Even position 30 = 30+ clicks/month

**Issue:** High impressions but terrible position = missing huge traffic

**Quick Fixes:**
- [ ] Update with 2026 pricing/availability
- [ ] Add comparison to Traeger Flatrock combo
- [ ] Strengthen E-E-A-T signals (real testing, photos, long-term update)
- [ ] Add FAQ schema for "is it worth it" queries

**Impact Estimate:**
Position 62 → Position 25 = **+1500% traffic** (~32 clicks/month)
