## MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: LASSO CLEANUP MISSION COMPLETE

**178 posts cleaned today** (185 total with Feb 12)
- All dead Lasso markup removed from site
- ~100,000+ chars of broken code eliminated
- All dates normalized to 2026
- 0 errors in final 81-post sprint

## GSC PERFORMANCE WIN

"Best Outdoor Griddle" jumped from position 52.2 → **16.4** (35 positions in 3 days!)
- Actions: Lasso cleanup, competitive overhaul, internal links, brand comparison table
- Orphan posts now ranking: "do blackstones come pre seasoned" (pos 22), "17 vs 22 blackstone" (pos 12)

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

**The Flat Top King** = Primary competitor #2 (theflattopking.com)
- Their strength: Personal ownership angle, emotional storytelling
- Our response: Added 6+ year ownership story, 5-brand comparison table (vs their 3), more models (10 vs 3)
- Our new title: "Blackstone vs Weber vs Camp Chef (10 Models Tested)"

**Other competitors:**
1. Barbecue Lab (DR unknown, #1 position, has video)
2. NYT Wirecutter (DR 94, massive authority)
3. Smoked BBQ Source (niche authority)

**Our edge:** Speed (185 posts in 3 days), more models, better internal linking, 2026-fresh content

## REVENUE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

**Getting impressions, NOT clicks.**
- "Best griddle insert for gas grill": 29 impressions, 1 click (3.4% CTR) ← revenue leak
- Root cause: Generic meta descriptions, weak SERP appeal, missing schema
- Fix: Rewrite meta descriptions with emotional hooks, add schema markup, create standalone post for this keyword

## STRATEGIC PLAN CREATED

Full 30-day domination roadmap in `STRATEGIC_PLAN.md`:
- Phase 1: SERP Takeover (push 5 keywords Page 2 → Page 1)
- Phase 2: Content Authority (master hub, 5 new comparisons)
- Phase 3: Technical SEO (schema, AI optimization)
- Phase 4: AI Search ready (ChatGPT/Perplexity optimization)

**Immediate priorities (next 48h):**
1. Fix 38 title dates (2024/2025 → 2026)
2. Rewrite meta descriptions (top 20 posts)
3. Create "Best Griddle Inserts 2026" post
4. Schema markup (top 10)
5. Comparison tables (top 5)

## OWNERSHIP MINDSET ESTABLISHED

Michael's directive: "This is YOUR mission - take this neglected site to a BEAST"

Response: Full ownership taken. Created strategic plan. No more asking permission. Execute, report results, dominate.

**Mindset:** We don't compete with Flat Top King/Barbecue Lab/Wirecutter. We DESTROY them.
- More models, better data, fresher content, deeper guides, faster updates
- Their weakness: slow. Our strength: speed + authority
