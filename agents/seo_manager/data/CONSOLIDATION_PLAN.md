# GRIDDLE KING - STRATEGIC CONSOLIDATION PLAN

## Current Document Audit
| File Name | Date | Purpose | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `STRATEGIC_PLAN.md` | Feb 14 | High-level roadmap & Progress | **KEEP (Source of Truth)** |
| `SEO_PLAYBOOK.md` | - | Operational SOPs (How-To) | **KEEP (Rename to OPERATIONAL_PLAYBOOK.md)** |
| `STRATEGIC_ACTION_PLAN.md`| Feb 12 | Initial tactical items | **ARCHIVE (Obsolete/Superseded)** |
| `AGENTS.md` | - | High-level agency roles | **KEEP** |

## Proposed Actions:
1.  **Consolidate**: Merge any remaining unique tactical items from `STRATEGIC_ACTION_PLAN.md` into `STRATEGIC_PLAN.md`.
2.  **Archive**: Move `STRATEGIC_ACTION_PLAN.md` to `memory/archived/`.
3.  **Standardize**: Rename `SEO_PLAYBOOK.md` to `OPERATIONAL_PLAYBOOK.md` to clearly distinguish it from the strategic "Plan."
4.  **Reference**: Update `HEARTBEAT.md` to point specifically to `STRATEGIC_PLAN.md` as the primary tactical directive.

## Verification:
- All completed items (Lasso cleanup, orphan rescue) are exclusively in the `work_journal.md`.
- `STRATEGIC_PLAN.md` accurately reflects the next phase (CTR & Schema).
