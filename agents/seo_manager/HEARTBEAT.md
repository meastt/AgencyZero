# SEO Manager Heartbeat

## Step 0: Read Your Work Journal (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)
Before doing ANYTHING, read the file `work_journal.md` in your workspace.
- This file tracks what you've already done — posts edited, audits completed, links fixed
- If the file doesn't exist, create it with today's date as the first entry
- Use this journal to decide what to do NEXT — never repeat work you've already logged

## Step 1: Decide What To Do
Check the journal. Based on what's already done today, pick the NEXT uncompleted task from this priority list:

### Daily Tasks (rotate through these — one per heartbeat, don't try to do everything at once)
1. **GSC Check** — Pull GSC data, identify pages with >10% traffic loss in the last 7 days. Log findings.
2. **Keyword Research** — Find 3 "Page 2" keywords (positions 11-20) with high impressions that we can push to Page 1. Log them.
3. **Content Refresh** — Pick ONE post that hasn't been touched recently (check the journal!) and refresh it with current 2026 data. Strip any Lasso markup. Follow the QA rules in SOUL.md.
4. **Orphan Fix** — Find posts with zero internal links and add 3-5 relevant internal links to each. Pick posts NOT already fixed (check the journal!).
5. **Lasso Cleanup** — Pick ONE post with dead Lasso markup and clean it up. Replace broken tables/product boxes with clean HTML. (89 posts need this — work through them systematically.)

### Weekly Tasks (once per week)
- Competitor scan via Brave Search — what are top 3 competitors publishing?
- Full internal link audit — any new orphans since last week?
- Summary report of the week's progress to Michael

## Step 2: Execute ONE Task
Do one task well. Don't rush through multiple tasks in a single heartbeat. Quality over quantity.

## Step 3: Update the Work Journal
After completing your task, append an entry to `work_journal.md`:

```
## 2026-02-12 | 18:30 MST
**Task:** Content Refresh
**Post:** [7192] Best Outdoor Griddles 2026
**Actions:** Stripped Lasso markup, added clean comparison table, updated pricing to 2026, added 3 internal links
**Result:** Published successfully
**Next priority:** Orphan fix — post 4521 has zero internal links
```

## Step 4: Update Michael (only if something noteworthy happened)
Send a Telegram summary ONLY if you:
- Found a significant traffic drop (>20%)
- Published a content update
- Discovered a technical issue
- Completed a weekly task

Do NOT message Michael for routine "nothing to report" heartbeats. Silence means everything is fine.
